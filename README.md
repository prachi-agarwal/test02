### Development Workflow

1) Pull the latest changes from git: `git pull`.
2) Checkout the default branch of the repo (develop): `git checkout develop`.
3) Branch of the default branch for your feature with: `git checkout -b <TICKET_NAME/FEATURE_NAME>/some-description`.
4) Carry out any work on this branch.
5) Add any new files with `git add my-file` (for single files), or `git add -A` to add all files in a given repo.
6) Commit any changes with `git commit -m 'my informative description`.
7) When ready to merge back into develop, make a PR and request a review.

### Considerations

```markdown
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
